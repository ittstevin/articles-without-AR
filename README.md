# articles-without-AR

This is a simple project that demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming concepts in Ruby. The project consists of three classes, Author, Magazine, and Article, and their respective methods. The classes have various associations and aggregate methods that allow for data retrieval and manipulation.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Open the project directory using a text editor
3. Open a terminal window in the project directory
4. Install any required gems by running `bundle install`
5. Run the project by running the command `ruby environment/environment.rb`

- This will run the project's main files ;  Articles.rb ,  Author.rb , Magazine.rb and it will demonstrate the use of the classes and their methods.

To use the project, you can modify the code in the ru.rb file to create new instances of the classes and call their respective methods. You can also create new helper methods if needed to aid in data retrieval and manipulation.
The code is commented to explain what each part of the code does, and the various methods of the classes are documented to explain their purpose and usage.
